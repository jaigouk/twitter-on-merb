h1. Motivation

Hi. My name is Jai-Gouk Kim, a newbie in merb community. I'm not a ruby guru. I started digging into merb recently and found out awesomeness of merb. I bought "Merb in Action" but there was no notice about further works and It's really hard to get informations about changes like between 1.0.7 and 1.0.7.1. Since I don't have experiences related with merb, I wanted explanations about them. Katz's blog posts are good but I need more than that. So I parsed rss feeds here.  I know my codes are not beutiful. I just hope this codes help someone who just started merb. I will follow the edge version of merb, and make sure this small app works so that this example app is useful as it is.

Thanks to merb core team, rubypond, giom, monki, and FoobarWidget. Ruby community is cool! They really helped me to build this small app.
