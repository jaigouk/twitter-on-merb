eddited config/framework.rb Because I could not use twitter_search gem to verify the message is unique or not. This is same as twitter timeline api. It seems that they use cache. Therefor I had to add a model to check the message I'm sending is unique or not. 

<script src="http://gist.github.com/44598.js"></script>

All I need to do was add   :model => Merb.root / "models". And write dependencies at init.rb file.
<script src="http://gist.github.com/44600.js"></script>

$merb-gen model tweet
<script src="http://gist.github.com/44599.js"></script>
$rake db:automigrate
Since merb flat app has a single controller file, It was easy too start. But the twitter api and nokogiri took some time to use. I picked one of the recommended templates from samshmagazine.(http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2008/12/01/100-free-high-quality-xhtmlcss-templates/)

There were 3 or 4 ruby libraries for twitter. And twitter4r has more documents than the others. It took much time to discover that timeline api and search api use cache. I just forgot about the cache. Anyway I installed necessary gems. 

$sudo gem install twitter4r twitter nokogiri shorturl

And then I eddited index.html.erb file. In the controller, it only needs render method.
<script src="http://gist.github.com/44605.js"></script>

Since I was not familiar with nokogiri, I googled and found this tutorial. (http://www.robertsosinski.com/2008/12/08/scraping-pages-made-easy-with-ruby-and-nokogiri/). Actually, I just wanted to use feedtools and feedupdater gem. But there were not enough document to reference and as merb-book says, I better not use codes that I don't understand. Scraping pages with nokogiri is easy but my app would be fragile. 

<script src="http://gist.github.com/44610.js"></script>

I know the codes above is not that beautiful. But I hope this code help another rubist who want  example. As you see above, k.content which was return by nokogiri's search method was Hash. This is why i used to_s method. 
And posting a message to twitter was tricky for me. Because of increasing popularity of twitter, posting throuth api was too fast for twitter sometimes. Posting messages takes much time and that code block needs to sleep. So I wrapped the block with run_later. If I was developing on Rails, I would dig starling. But just one run_later block does the background work.

<script src="http://gist.github.com/44612.js"></script>

That is what I've done for 2days. Well, I hope this little app help another merbists. And I used bellow code to delete all tweets.

I still did not implemented job scheduling(Jan 8, 2009) and caching is just what I need now.
I referenced bellow links to learn merb-cache.

Merb-cache's methods written by Guillaume Maury on Dec 19, 2008 
http://gom-jabbar.org/articles/2008/12/19/merb-cache-s-methods

Here's quick introduction

<quote>
== Quick intro
  With fragment caching, you can mix dynamic and static content.
 
  With action caching, the whole template is cached
  but the before filters are still processed.
 
  With page caching, the whole template is put in html files in a special
  directory in order to be handled directly without triggering Merb.

But my init file was wrong and throws erros whenever I run "rake db:automigrate" since I set up the cache(http://gist.github.com/44702). I really didn't know how to fix this. At first, I guessed that datamapper version could be the reason why causes it. After updating the gems, error were still there. Fortunately I have known him recently via twitter. He helped to get out of this. This code was not familiar with me. I thought I knew the way to setup the cache.  

<script src='http://pastie.org/355604.js'></script>

The codes were already in his article (http://gom-jabbar.org/articles/2008/12/14/example-nginx-configuration-for-merb-with-page-caching-using-the-file-store) But I run my apps on passenger so I simply skipped it. :)  I highly recommand his blog if you are intereted in Merb2 or Rails3. Again I ran the command, I got errors again. :(

<script src="http://gist.github.com/44727.js"></script>

So it was not only the wrong merb-cache setup. Where is the bug? 
I have two do_sqlite3 (0.9.10.1, 0.9.9). If I set dm_gems_version   = "0.9.9", running rake -T throws this error.

<script src="http://gist.github.com/44734.js"></script>

I even uninstalled version 0.9.10.1 and rake -T error says "already activated data_objects-0.9.10.1". 

in my Rakefile line #12,
# Load the basic runtime dependencies; this will include 
# any plugins and therefore plugin rake tasks.
init_env = ENV['MERB_ENV'] || 'rake'
Merb.load_dependencies(:environment => init_env)
     
I googled it and found the answer 
Matt Aimonetti says,
"bundle your app by doing `thor merb:gem:install`  and run your app by
doing `./bin/merb` "

But thor -T didn't work. "unable to load thorfile "
And I searched merb google group, And there were others who have same problem.

hehe so turned out I had the same problem and I didn't feel like fixing the
problem by any of the solutions given earlier.

I fixed the problem by editing my dependencies.rb file as follows:

dm_gems_version   = "0.9.9"

dependency "do_sqlite3", "0.9.10.1" # If using another database, replace this
dependency "do_mysql", "0.9.10.1", :require_as => nil
dependency "dm-core", dm_gems_version

The problem is that some DM/DO dependencies use loose dependencies and some
use some hard dependencies. I'll talk with the DM guys to get that fixed in
a future release.

Move the do_* adapters above dm-core and rebundle your app.

thor merb:gem:install 
</quote>

So I have to fix thor problem. The answer for this is write merb.thor on root directory.
http://github.com/wycats/merb/tree/master/merb-gen/lib/generators/templates/application/common/merb.thor?raw=true

I fixed thor problem and bundled gems. But "rake db:automigrate" fails. 
There was a ticket about this problem.
http://merb.lighthouseapp.com/projects/7433/tickets/618-rake-dbautomigrate-loads-initrb-twice
But I have merb 1.0.7.1 not the old version.  
These are the files that describes my problem. http://gist.github.com/44941

Again, giom helped me. Here is the snippet written by him.
<script src='http://pastie.org/356279.js'></script>

I referenced here.

$ wget  http://download.tangent.org/libmemcached-0.25.tar.gz

$ cd libmemcached-0.25.tar.gz
$ ./configure
$ make && sudo make install
$ sudo gem install memcached

To manage daemons, I installed rufus-scheduler and daemons gem.
